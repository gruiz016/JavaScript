# JavaScript
This will house all my introductory to advance code into the JS language. I have also included some built applications for your review. 
# During the class, I built three JavaScript applications
1. The first app, a note-taking app, is our starter application. I took the fundamentals of JavaScript and see exactly what it takes to build a program that allows users to add, edit, delete, and save their notes.

2. The second app, a to-do application. This test my skills and ensure that you have the real-world experience and problem-solving skills that are essential for writing JavaScript code.

3. The last app, a hangman word game, is used to explore the world of asynchronous JavaScript. I've set up applications that rely on data from third-party services that can offer up dynamic, real-time information such as the userâ€™s current location.
